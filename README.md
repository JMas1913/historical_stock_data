This dataset from [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) had me examine the top 10 stocks for a decade. I completed an EDA to understand the dataset. I then visualized the data both in Python and Tableau.
After visualizing the data, I completed a statistical analysis and performed 3 different statistical tests: Pearson's r, Spearman's rho, and Kendall's tau. With the results of these tests, I was able to reject the Null Hypothesis and accept the 
Alternative Hypothesis.
